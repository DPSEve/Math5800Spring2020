Basic idea. We are interested in multi-agent games, most notably Hanabi, as opposed to zero-sum or adversarial games. Hanabi is a cooperative game that requires players to make choices and inferences based on the actions of others.

The aforementioned code plays this game.

It goes over the mathematical fundamentals of combinatorial game theory, includes definitions and descriptions for zero-sum games, imperfecti information, et cetera. A more modern reference incorporating algorithms and machine learning would be good.}
